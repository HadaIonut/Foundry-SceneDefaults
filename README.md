This module is exactly what the name says. It adds the option to save a scene configuration to a default state. This default state is automatically applied to any new scene created.

# Installing

This module is available in the module browser

# Usage

## Making a default template
To make your current scene setup be the new default go to the scene creating menu and press the save as default button.

A default template is always applied to a newly created scene.

## Using templates
In the scene configuration menu you can add your current scene configuration to the list of saved templates by pressing the "Save Template" button.

Here you can either save the configuration by giving it a name and pressing the save button, or override an existing template by selecting it from the dropdown and pressing the save button.

## The template manager

The template manager is used to change default scenes and apply templates to the currently open scene configuration.

The template manager also shows you what data is contained in the selected template. This data is displayed in the JSON format with a small amount of indenting to make it more readable
